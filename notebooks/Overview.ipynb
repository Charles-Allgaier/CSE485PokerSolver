    "\n",
    "Our goal for this project is to create an agent to play Heads-Up No Limit Texas Holdem' Poker (HUNL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Poker has some defining characteristics which make creating a bot uniquely challenging.  Similar to chess, poker is a **turn-based** strategy game.  This means that players take turns choosing from available actions until the game is over.  We can model turn-based strategy games using a **game tree**, where each decision node branches out depending on which action is taken.  \n",
    "    Unlike Chess, Poker is a game with **imperfect information**.  This is important because it completely changes how we go about developing a strategy."
